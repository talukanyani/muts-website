                    Your Data Protection Rights under the California Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA)
                </h2>
                <p>
                    CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivable the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy.
                </p>
                <p>According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Users can visit our site anonymously.</li>
                    <li>
                        Our Privacy Policy link includes the word “Privacy”, and can easily be found on the home page of our website.
                    </li>
                    <li>
